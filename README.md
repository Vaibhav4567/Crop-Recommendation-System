# Crop-Recommendation-System

This project aims to recommend the most suitable crop for cultivation based on specific soil and weather conditions using machine learning algorithms.

## Project Overview

The project includes the following steps:

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: The crop recommendation dataset is loaded from a CSV file and preprocessed, including normalization and standardization of features.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Exploratory data analysis is performed to understand the distribution of data, check for correlations, and gain insights into the features.
3. **Model Building**: Several machine learning algorithms are trained on the preprocessed data to predict the best crop for given conditions.
4. **Model Evaluation**: The trained models are evaluated using accuracy metrics.
5. **Model Deployment**: The best-performing model is deployed in a web application to provide crop recommendations based on user input.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains the following features:

- Nitrogen (N)
- Phosphorus (P)
- Potassium (K)
- Temperature (°C)
- Humidity (%)
- pH
- Rainfall (mm)

The target variable is "label," indicating the recommended crop.

## Models Used

- **Logistic Regression**
- **Gaussian Naive Bayes**
- **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Decision Tree**
- **Extra Tree**
- **Random Forest**
- **Bagging Classifier**
- **Gradient Boosting Classifier**
- **AdaBoost Classifier**

The Random Forest Classifier performed the best with an accuracy of approximately 99.32%.

## Usage

### 1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/crop-recommendation-system.git
cd crop-recommendation-system
```

### 2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the web application:

```bash
python app.py
```

### 4. Access the application:

Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to access the crop recommendation system.

## Web Application

The web application allows users to input soil and weather conditions to get a crop recommendation. The form accepts the following inputs:

- Nitrogen (N)
- Phosphorus (P)
- Potassium (K)
- Temperature (°C)
- Humidity (%)
- pH
- Rainfall (mm)

After submitting the form, the application will display the recommended crop.

## Model Training and Saving

The model training code processes the data and trains various models. The best model is saved using pickle for later use in the web application.


## Conclusion

This project successfully builds a machine learning model to recommend the most suitable crop for cultivation based on soil and weather conditions. The model is integrated into a web application that allows users to input their data and receive crop recommendations.
